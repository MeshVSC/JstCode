## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Internal Server Error"**
   - **Cause**: Advanced features with browser compatibility issues
   - **Solution**: Features automatically disabled, core functionality works

2. **Build Warnings**  
   - **Cause**: ESLint rules on disabled code
   - **Solution**: Safe to ignore, app builds and runs successfully

3. **Missing Format Button**
   - **Cause**: Prettier integration disabled
   - **Status**: UI present, functionality will be restored in future update

4. **Console Not Working**
   - **Cause**: Sandpack message capture disabled  
   - **Status**: Panel UI works, message capture will be restored

### **Development Notes:**
- The app prioritizes stability over feature completeness
- Core multi-file editing experience is fully functional
- Advanced features are disabled but can be re-enabled once fixed
- All UI components are implemented and ready for feature restoration

## 🤖 Inter-Session Context for AI Assistance

### Claude Code Integration
JstCode includes a camera icon in the vertical menu bar for enhanced AI development assistance:

**Screenshot Workflow:**
1. Click the camera icon in the left menu bar
2. Screenshot is automatically captured and saved to your Downloads folder  
3. Drag the screenshot file to Claude Code chat for visual debugging assistance
4. Claude can provide contextual help based on your current interface state

**Context Instructions for Claude:**
- Always check latest screenshot when prompted with "check the latest screenshot"
- Delete screenshots after analysis to keep project clean
- Screenshots are used for UI debugging, layout issues, and real-time assistance
- This enables true copilot-style development with visual context

**Current Session Context:**
- Project uses VS Code color scheme: #1e1e1e, #252526, #2d2d30, #3e3e42
- Main layout: Explorer | Code Editor | Live Preview (3-panel resizable)
- File tree with multi-file support and tab management
- Monaco editor integration with live Sandpack preview
- All core features fully working and optimized for performance

**Latest Updates (This Session):**
- ✅ **Smart Project Loading**: Auto-detects main file from package.json configuration
- ✅ **HTML File Support**: Direct HTML preview with iframe rendering and script detection
- ✅ **Path Alias Resolution**: Automatic @/ import resolution for complex projects  
- ✅ **Global Drag & Drop**: Drop folders anywhere on the app interface
- ✅ **Professional Icons**: Replaced all emoji icons with clean SVG graphics
- ✅ **Improved Error Handling**: Better preview fallbacks and error recovery
- ✅ **Console Optimization**: Enhanced console message parsing and display
- ✅ **Fixed Preview Flickering**: Resolved red/black screen alternation issues
- ✅ **Enhanced Dependencies**: Added esbuild-wasm, @babel/standalone for custom bundling
- ✅ **Routing Improvements**: Automatic BrowserRouter to HashRouter conversion
- ⚠️ **Multi-page HTML Navigation**: Partial implementation (see Known Issues)

## 🚨 **Current Known Issues - Multi-page HTML Navigation**

### **Problem:**
Multi-page HTML projects with separate .html files (like nymph project) cannot navigate between pages in the preview. Clicking navigation elements (cards, buttons) that should navigate to `/dashboard.html` results in 404 errors.

### **What Was Tried:**
1. **Custom esbuild-wasm Bundler**: Created CustomPreview.tsx with esbuild-wasm for real bundling
   - **Result**: Black screen, bundler too complex for browser environment
   - **Files**: CustomPreview.tsx (exists but not used)

2. **Sandpack Routing Fixes**: Automatic BrowserRouter to HashRouter conversion
   - **Result**: Works for single-page React apps, but nymph project uses separate .html files
   - **Files**: LivePreview.tsx (lines 61-90)

3. **Multi-page HTML Navigation Handler**: JavaScript injection to intercept clicks and load target HTML files
   - **Result**: Syntax errors, excessive debug output, navigation still fails
   - **Files**: LivePreview.tsx (lines 207-247)

### **Root Cause:**
The nymph project is a multi-page HTML application with separate files (index.html, dashboard.html) that expect server-side routing. Sandpack is designed for single-page React applications and cannot handle multi-file HTML navigation.

### **Next Steps - Suggestions:**
1. **Simple iframe switching**: Create a file selector dropdown that switches iframe src between HTML files
2. **Server simulation**: Create a mini HTTP server simulation in the preview iframe
3. **File concatenation**: Merge all HTML files into a single-page app with JavaScript routing
4. **Accept limitation**: Document that multi-page HTML navigation is not supported in preview

### **Files Modified:**
- `package.json`: Added esbuild-wasm, @babel/standalone dependencies
- `LivePreview.tsx`: Added routing fixes and navigation handlers
- `CustomPreview.tsx`: Created (unused) custom bundler component

**Next Session TODO:**
- Fix multi-page HTML navigation using one of the suggested approaches above
- Remove unused CustomPreview.tsx component
- Clean up navigation handler code in LivePreview.tsx
